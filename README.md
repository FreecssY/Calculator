# Calculator

This project is a simple scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific functions, including trigonometric calculations, exponents, and square roots.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Scientific operations: exponentiation, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and square roots.
- Use of the mathematical constant π (Pi).
- Advanced mode for trigonometric and scientific functions that can be toggled on and off.
- History panel to keep track of previous calculations.
- Keyboard input support for better user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FreecssY/Calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd Calculator
   ```

3. Open the `public/index.html` file in your preferred web browser to use the calculator.

## Usage

- Click on the buttons to enter numbers and operations, or use your keyboard for input.
- Use the "Advanced" button to toggle additional functions like sin, cos, tan, square root, and exponentiation.
- The calculator history displays the last few calculations and can be adjusted in size.
- Use the backspace button (←) to delete the last character or operation.
- The "C" button clears the entire display.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Numbers: `0-9`
- Decimal point: `.`
- Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
- Trigonometric functions: Type "sin", "cos", or "tan" and press enter.
- Square root: Type "sqrt(" followed by the number and closing parenthesis `)`.
- Pi (π): Type "pi"
- Backspace: `Backspace`
- Calculate: `Enter`
- Clear display: `Escape`
